     * If we want to actually create the array / initlize it we always need 1 thing:
     * the array size
     * 
     * The reason why we always need the array size is because whatever is running
     * the program needs to know how much memory to allocate for the variable(s) in
     * RAM
     * 
     * There are two ways we can specify the size of the array, implicitely or
     * explicitely.
     * 
     * When we define an array using the explicit method, we create the array but
     * all the values in the array are defaulted as NULL, or undefined

     * differant way, You will learn more about it later but just know that there is
     * a reason and its not just arbitruary.
     * 
     * The number inside the new int[] is us explicitely telling that we want an
     * array of 60 integers.
     * 
     * NOTE All 60 of the integers have been set to, by default, to an undefined
     * value. Because the array type is an intger, all those 60 values in the array
     * default to 0
     * 
     * Key to use if you want to know what the default is
     * 
     * double -> 0.0
     * 
     * float -> 0.0f
     * 
     * integer-> 0
     * 
     * byte -> 0
     * 
     * short -> 0
     * 
     * string -> "" (Empty string)
     * 
     * char -> "î€€" (Null termination character, binary is just 0000 0000 (all 0s) )

     * want to input (builtin values eg. names or something)
